                    Since 2018, I have been using my programming skills to tackle business challenges and
                    have honed my ability to excel in fast-paced and high-pressure environments,
                    particularly within the finance and energy sectors.

                <i>
                    My expertise extends beyond just technical abilities and into a deep understanding
                    of the business and the root of the problems I work to solve. I'm confident that my
                    unique blend of technical and business savvy makes me the ideal partner for anyone
                    looking for a top-notch developer.

            <h2>What I can do</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>Programming</strong>: I am the most confident with the C# .NET stack, but I'd be happy to step
                out of my comfort zone. I can also design and build APIs. <a
                    href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!AuxoCjUHmxhihJBsvbB8BmxHUj5QyA?e=WA7WDE">See my CV</a> for a
                more detailed list of tech buzzwords.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Solution design</strong>: I have taken complex problems and developed clear and
                actionable plans to solve them, taking into account the unique constraints and requirements of each
                situation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Consultancy</strong>: From project inception to delivery I've been at the forefront of
                handling, managing and implementing business ideas into solutions.
            </p>
            </p>

            <p>
            <h2>What sets me apart</h2>

            <p>
                <strong>I care</strong>: as a freelancer, my reputation is everything. With limited time on each
                project,
                I am driven to make the most of every opportunity and deliver results that truly exceed expectations.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>I see the big picture</strong>: I don't just look at things from a tech point of view.
                Before making important decisions, I make sure to study the field and think about what the end-user
                really needs.
                I like to take a well-rounded approach to decision-making.
            </p>
            </p>

            <h2>What others have to say</h2>

            <strong>Rafael N. <i>CTO at CF Partners</i></strong>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Usman made a huge impact in the time that he worked with us at CF Partners. He has the rare
                    combination of awesome technical skills and the ability to communicate supremely with his peers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During his time here he's consistently delivered way above expectations. His C# skills are
                    excellent, but even more impressive is his ability to foster close collaboration and his drive to
                    make the project succeed. He has improved communication and process across teams in our London
                    office and built strong ties with teams co-located internationally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope to work with Usman again in the future and would offer him a permanent position on the team
                    without hesitation.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <strong>Mark R. <i>Head of Development at BlueBay Asset Management</i></strong>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    I had the opportunity to work alongside Usman at BlueBay for a year and came to appreciate his
                    exceptional productivity as a developer. He has a talent for simplifying complex issues and is
                    always willing to roll up his sleeves to get the job done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite his determination, Usman never compromises his integrity and openly expresses his opinions.
                    He is a versatile full-stack developer who can independently build comprehensive solutions and dive
                    into the details as needed.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            <strong>Francis M. <i>Software Engineer and Founder of Blocl</i></strong>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Usman is a top-notch developer who excels in navigating complex environments and finding innovative
                    solutions to challenging problems. He is skilled at considering the needs of users and defining
                    clear objectives that result in valuable product features. Usman is dependable and insightful,
                    consistently delivering high-quality work on schedule.

            <h2>What I would like to work on</h2>

            My main ambition is to lead a successful SaaS company of my own, but in the meantime,
            I am eager to collaborate with like-minded organizations that are driven to make a difference.
            I am passionate about using my skills and experience to help these companies achieve their goals,
            and I believe I would be a valuable asset to any project.

            <p>
                <strong>Innovation:</strong> I love taking on new projects that challenge the norm and find
                creative solutions to technical problems. Greenfield projects excite me and I'm always up for the
                challenge.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Causes:</strong> I care about the environment, social responsibility and efficiency.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Positive Impact:</strong> I aim to not only deliver results on a project,
                but also to create a positive and lasting impact on the world around us.
            </p>
